Write the name of the Dish and it gives you the detailed procdure of creating the recipe. 

### Motivation
Ever had a bunch of recipes and you didn't know what recipe to cook using them? And what if you only knew the name of the recipe? 
Many people* face these problems. Traditional search engines (Google, Bing, etc.) fail to return recipes because they only look for recipes as the query.

**But what if you can search for any recipe? We did just that.**

*Think of students, refugees, and people on a minimal budget.
