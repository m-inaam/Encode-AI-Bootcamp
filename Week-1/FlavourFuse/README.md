Write the name of the Dish and it gives you the detailed procdure of creating the recipe. 

### Motivation
Ever had a bunch of recipes and you didn't know what recipe to cook using them? And what if you only knew the name of the recipe? 
Many people* face these problems. Traditional search engines (Google, Bing, etc.) fail to return recipes because they only look for recipes as the query.

**But what if you can search for any recipe? We did just that.**

*Think of students, refugees, and people on a minimal budget.

### How it works
1. Write the name of the dish 
2. Select your preferred cuisine
3. Add dietary restrictions (if any)

### Results
It will generate the following things:
1. Name of the Recipe
2. Instructions to Create the Recipe.
