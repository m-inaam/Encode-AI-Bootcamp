# Multilingual Recipe Search Engine
Given a list of ingredients in some language X, the engine returns the closest matching recipe in language X. 

### Motivation
Ever had a bunch of ingredients and you didn't know what recipe to cook using them? And what if you only knew the ingredients in a specific language? 
Many people* face these problems. Traditional search engines (Google, Bing, etc.) fail to return recipes because they only look for recipes written in the same language as the query.

**But what if you can search for any recipe in any language? We did just that.**

*Think of students, refugees, and people on a minimal budget.
